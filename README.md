## Rugby Positions Explained
In rugby, each position demands a unique combination of physical and technical skills, and every player has specific responsibilities on the field.


### Forwards
Every rugby team has 8 Forwards. Renowned as the workhorses of the team, Forwards will generally score Fantasy points for scrums, lineouts and defensive actions like making tackles.


### Fly Half
The Fly Half is often the most influential player on the pitch, responsible for orchestrating a teamâ€™s attack and defence. Most Fly Halves are also great kickers, scoring Fantasy points for conversions and penalties.


### Half Back
The Half Back is the team's heartbeat - making decisions, linking play, throwing key passes, and kicking accurately. Scrum Halves will often score Fantasy points for offloads, try assists and linebreaks.


### Midfielders
Your Midfielders can play both inside and outside roles. They will score Fantasy points through line breaks and metres gained.


### Back Three
The Back Three are usually among the fastest players in any rugby team. They will be scoring a ton of Fantasy points through tries, linebreaks, try-saving tackles and metres gained!
